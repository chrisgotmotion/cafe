    <p>
        Cafe Vibez is a family cafe that has existed for years and has been passed down from generation to generation as a family business to be cherished and grown.
        The current owner is Joe Goldburg, who was handed the business a while back and has since taken great care of it and has taken it to great heights.
        We haved faced great challenges in maintaining and keeping the standard of the coffee shop on an exceptional level.
        The shop has been around for over 30 years and has been renovated multiple times to in with the modern look at the given time.
